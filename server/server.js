// Serve up static assets
// In production, the Express.js app will use the value of process.env.PORT instead of 3001. 
// Heroku won't let us use Create React App's default port of 3000, though. Regardless, 
// we wouldn't want to run nodemon or the Create React App server because neither codebase 
// would be dynamically changing once deployed.
// Ultimately, we only need a static Node.js server that serves the built 
// (i.e., compiled) front-end files.
// We just added two important pieces of code that will only come into effect 
// when we go into production. First, we check to see if the Node environment 
// is in production (at Heroku). If it is, we instruct the Express.js server to serve any 
// files in the React application's build directory in the client folder.
// remember this is for production only.
// When deployed, the Express.js app will attempt to serve all static files in 
// client/build. We just need to make sure those files exist on Heroku.
// One thing we could do is build the files manually with the react-scripts build command 
// and then commit the files with Git. But this approach could lead to unnecessary merge 
// conflicts as other developers start working on the app and building the files themselves.
// Alternatively, we could tell Heroku to build the front-end files whenever a push is made to 
// production. This would guarantee that Heroku always has the latest version in case a 
// developer ever forgets to manually build. Let's give this option a try.
// We do this in the package.json with the "build" command.
// Remember that Heroku will automatically look for the start command to run your app. 
// Heroku will also try to run a build command if it can find it.
// The build command in the package.json will tell Heroku to cd into the client 
// folder after the initial install and build the React files for you, so that it will happen
// automatically. 
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build')));
}

// The next set of functionality we created was a wildcard GET route for the 
// server. In other words, if we make a GET request to any location on the 
// server that doesn't have an explicit route defined, respond with the production-ready 
// React front-end code.
