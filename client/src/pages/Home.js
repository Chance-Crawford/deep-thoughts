// we're importing the useQuery Hook from Apollo Client. This will allow us 
// to make requests to the GraphQL server we connected to and made available 
// to the application using the <ApolloProvider> component in App.js earlier.
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
// We also imported the QUERY_THOUGHTS query we just created in 
// utils/queries.js. Now we just need to use the query with the imported 
// Hook functionality, and we'll be able to query thought data!
import { QUERY_THOUGHTS } from '../utils/queries';

import ThoughtList from '../components/ThoughtList';

const Home = () => {
  // use useQuery hook to make query request.
  // When we load the Home component in the application, we'll execute the 
  // query for the thought data. Because this is asynchronous, just like 
  // using fetch(), Apollo's @apollo/client library provides a loading property 
  // to indicate that the request isn't done just yet. When it's finished and we have 
  // data returned from the server, that information is stored in the destructured data property.
  // Working with Promise-based functionality in React can get cumbersome. But with the 
  // loading property, we'll be able to conditionally render data based on whether or not 
  // there is data to even display.
  const { loading, data } = useQuery(QUERY_THOUGHTS);

  // Next we'll get the thought data out of the query's response, because every GraphQL 
  // response comes in a big data object. In this case, we'll need to access data.thoughts. 
  // So what's this weird syntax? This is called optional chaining, and it's new to 
  // JavaScriptâ€”so new that only browsers seem to support it. If we tried to use it 
  // in a Node server, we'd receive a syntax error, because Node doesn't know what it is yet.
  // Optional chaining negates the need to check if an object even exists before accessing 
  // its properties. In this case, no data will exist until the query to the server is finished.
  // What we're saying is, if data exists, store it in the thoughts constant we just created. 
  // If data is undefined, then save an empty array to the thoughts component.
  const thoughts = data?.thoughts || [];
